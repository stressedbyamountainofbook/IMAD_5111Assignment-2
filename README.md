explanation of my Tamagotchi app
the app is made in the image of the tamagotchi app from the nineties in which you would be taking care of bathing,feeding and playing with a virtual pet
the name of my app is hector
hector is the name of your pitbull virtual pet
there are three pet life values in the app that include hunger,cleanliness and hapiness
it is the user's responsibility as a player to make sure they do not reach zero as that would show their irresponsibility and inability to care for the life of their pet
the pet life values decrease in 3 second intervals to keep the user engaged even though in different quantities.
once the user click on any of the buttons for raising life values there will be an animation 
pethunger is raised by the feed button.it decreases by 5 units every three seconds and feeding raises it by 10 units along with pet health which can be interpreted as pet joy
pethealth is raised by playing with your pet.it decreases by 4 units every 3 seconds and playing with your pet raises it ny10 each time while reducing hunger and cleanliness by 5 units
petcleanliness is raised by cleaning your pet.it decreases by 6 every 3 seconds and and cleaning your pet raises it ny 10 each time along with pethealth
when feeding your pet the animation of a dog eating will appear for 8 seconds before it returns to the default image
when cleaning your pet the animation of a dog bathing will appear for 8 seconds before it returns to the default image
when playing with your pet the animation of a dog playing and running with a toy will appear for 8 seconds before it returns to the default image
